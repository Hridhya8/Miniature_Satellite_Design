## Overview

This repository presents the design and development of a CanSat (miniature satellite) for air quality monitoring using the Advanced Node Communication Enhancement Strategy (ANCES). This project aims to enhance communication reliability and range in CanSat missions, leveraging innovative design and advanced technology to improve real-time data transmission.

## Contents

- **Design_Document.pdf**: Detailed documentation of the CanSat design, including technical specifications, components, and fabrication process.
- **Results**: Results from CanSat missions and testing.
- **Transmitter Code**: Firmware for the CanSat's communication transmitter module.
- **Receiver Code**: Firmware for the ground station's communication receiver module.
- **ANCES Method Code**: Implementation of the Advanced Node Communication Enhancement Strategy.

## Components Used

1. **Arduino Nano**: Core microcontroller for data handling and subsystem control.
2. **HC-12 Communication Module**: Wireless communication module for long-range data transmission.
3. **Gas Sensors (MQ-135 and MiCS-6814)**: Measure air quality parameters like CO, NH3, and NO2.
4. **Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11)**: Measures environmental conditions.
5. **Boost Converter**: Regulates voltage to ensure stable operation.
6. **Lithium Polymer (LiPo) Battery**: Power source for CanSat operation.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Node Communication Enhancement Strategy (ANCES)**: Improves communication reliability and range using strategic node placement and advanced technology.
- **Yagi-Uda Antenna Design**: Directional antenna for efficient signal transmission.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with PyQt5 for real-time data visualization and analysis.
- **Hexagonal Pattern Structure**: Enhances structural integrity and strength.
- **Parachute Design**: Ensures controlled descent with Ripstop Nylon material.


## Usage

1. Assemble the CanSat components as per the design specifications.
2. Deploy the CanSat during the mission, ensuring proper configuration of the HC-12 modules.
3. Use the GUI application to monitor and analyze the data collected during the mission.
